## Reading Assignment 12: Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP)

- Read the original paper, listen to audio examples and have a look at the code provided on the official website [DDSP: Differentiable digital signal processing](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp)

## Optional Reading

There are several interesting follow-up works that are worth checking out:
- [Differentiable Wavetable Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10003)
- [MIDI-DDSP: Detailed Control of Musical Performance via Hierarchical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09312)
- [Real-time Timbre Transfer and Sound Synthesis using DDSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07220)
- [Latent Space Explorations of Singing Voice Synthesis using DDSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07197)

Furthermore, this paper contains an interesting discussion on shortcomings of the loss commonly used for DDSP:
- [I'm Sorry for Your Loss: Spectrally-Based Audio Distances Are Bad at Pitch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04572)
