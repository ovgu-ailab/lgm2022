## Reading Assignment 7: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) continued

[Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics -- Remainder of Chapter 25](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html)

## Former Reading Assignment (optional)

- [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
- [Improved WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028)

In both papers, concern yourself with the high-level ideas. You don't need to
understand all the mathematical details (but give it a shot!) and you can of
course skip the appendices.
There is also [a less technical treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08994v1)
of these concepts which may be easier to follow for you.

- [Progressive Growing of GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196). These NVIDIA papers
  are usually very well written, providing justifications for their ideas,
  ablation studies for what happens when you leave them out, as well as noting
  all the "little tricks" that make the big idea actually work.
- If you still have time, check out [StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948)
(follow-up to progressive growing) as well.
- Finally, this is very readable and highly recommended for context: 
  [Wasserstein GANs work because they fail](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01678.pdf). 

## Optional Further Reading

- There is even a [StyleGAN2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958)!
- [Open GAN Problems](https://distill.pub/2019/gan-open-problems/): To get a 
taste of unanswered questions.
- [Adversarial Audio Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04208) and
 [GANSynth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08710) if you want to see some non-image
 applications.
