## Reading Assignment 8: Autoregressive Networks (ARNs)

### Autoregressive models in general

- [Sections 20.10.7 to 20.10.10 from the Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html) about types of autoregressive networks: ARNs, linear ARNs, neural ARNs, NADE
- [Chapter 21 from Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html) which covers more recent developments

### Optional deeper reading on some successful ARNs
- [PixelRNN & PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759)
- WaveNet ([blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-a-generative-model-raw-audio/), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499))
- [PixelCNN extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328)
- [parallel WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10433)

### Former Reading Assignment (optional)
- [Autoregressive Generative Models in depth : Part 1-5 by Thomas Jubb](https://thomasjubb.blog/autoregressive-generative-models-in-depth-part-1/)
